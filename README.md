# The Odin Project - Restaurant Page Project (9)

This is the third project of twelve in total included in the JavaScript course, the fifth within the Fullstack JS developer path of The Odin Project.
For this project, the request is to build a Landing Page for a Restaurant (I have decided to do it for a coffee store). The main objective of the project is to practice with Webpack and the modularization of the code in JS (import/export).
In addition to this, I decided to approach the project with a 'mobile-first' and fully responsive approach, so that the final result is more similar to a real project.

It is still in progress

Tools: HTML / CSS / JS

Key concepts: npm / ES6 modules / Webpack / Mobile-first / Responsive design
